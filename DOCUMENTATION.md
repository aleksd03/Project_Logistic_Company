┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         PRESENTATION LAYER          │
│     (JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
                 ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│          WEB LAYER (MVC)            │
│    (Servlets, Filters, DTOs)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
                 ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         SERVICE LAYER               │
│    (Business Logic, Services)       │

│    (Hibernate, JPA, Entities)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
                 ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│          DATABASE                   │
│           (MySQL)                   │

### 7.3. Design Patterns

#### Singleton Pattern
- `SessionFactoryUtil` - Single Hibernate SessionFactory instance

#### DAO Pattern
- All DAO classes - Data access logic abstraction

#### DTO Pattern
- Data Transfer Objects - Data transfer between layers

#### Filter Chain Pattern
- `AuthFilter`, `RoleFilter` - Security layer

#### Service Layer Pattern
- Service classes - Business logic isolation

## 9. SECURITY

### 9.1. Authentication

**Password Storage:**
- Passwords are hashed using **BCrypt** (cost factor 12)
- Plain text passwords are never stored
- Salt is automatically generated by BCrypt

**Session Management:**
- HTTP Sessions for storing user state
- Session timeout: 30 minutes (default Tomcat)
- Session invalidation on logout

### 9.2. Authorization

**Servlet Filters:**

1. **AuthFilter** (`/*`)
    - Checks if user is logged in
    - Redirects to `/login` if not
    - Public URLs: `/`, `/login`, `/register`, `/logout`, `/assets/*`

2. **RoleFilter** (specific URLs)
    - Checks user role
    - `/employee-shipments` - EMPLOYEE only
    - `/client-shipments` - CLIENT only
    - Returns 403 Forbidden for insufficient permissions

### 9.3. Attack Protection

**SQL Injection:**
- Hibernate parameterized queries
- Never string concatenation in HQL

**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**
- JSTL auto-escaping of output
- No direct `<%= %>` scriptlets with user input

**CSRF:**
- CSRF tokens implementation recommended (future enhancement)

**Session Hijacking:**
- HTTPS recommended in production
- Secure cookies

## 10. INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

### 10.1. Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 17 or newer
- **Apache Tomcat** 10.1.x
- **MySQL Server** 8.0 or newer
- **Gradle** 8.x (or use included wrapper)

### 10.2. Installation Steps

#### Step 1: Clone the Project
```bash
# Extract the project to a folder
unzip Project_Logistic_Company.zip
cd Project_Logistic_Company
```

#### Step 2: Database Configuration

Edit `src/main/resources/hibernate.properties`:

```properties
hibernate.connection.username=your_mysql_username
hibernate.connection.password=your_mysql_password
hibernate.connection.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/logistic_company?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
```

**Note:** Hibernate will automatically create the database and tables on first run (hbm2ddl.auto=update).

#### Step 3: Build the Project

**Windows:**
```bash
gradlew.bat clean build
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

This will generate a WAR file at `build/libs/Project_Logistic_Company.war`

#### Step 4: Deploy to Tomcat

**Option 1: Manual Copy**
```bash
cp build/libs/Project_Logistic_Company.war $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/
```

**Option 2: Tomcat Manager**
- Open `http://localhost:8080/manager`
- Upload WAR file through the interface

#### Step 5: Start Tomcat

**Windows:**
```bash
$TOMCAT_HOME\bin\startup.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/startup.sh
```

#### Step 6: Access the Application

Open a browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080/Project_Logistic_Company/
```

### 10.3. Initial Configuration

1. **Register the first user as EMPLOYEE**
2. **Create a company** (if it doesn't exist automatically)
3. **Create offices**
4. **Start registering shipments**
